That's machine learning, it's the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Machine Learning had grown up as a sub-field of AI or artificial intelligence. We wanted to build intelligent machines. It turns out that there are a few basic things that we could program a machine to do, such as how to find the shortest path from a to b, like in your GPS. But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays or build a self-driving car. The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself.
Here's a definition of what is machine learning that is attributed to Arthur Samuel. She defined machine learning as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
